Users a presented with this opening screen which describes how to use the app as well as a song of the day.  This feature
is currently hard coded and maybe implemented at a later date.

Due to Taste Dives API policy, each user is asked to supply their own api key, shown above.
Each user can add any number of artists, movies and tv shows. The supplied add and remove artist button make this an easy
task.

![App error message](https://github.com/sretundijr/first-capstone/blob/master/wireframes/Screen%20Shot%202017-04-30%20at%203.41.49%20PM.png)

This error message was added to notify the users of the API rate limit exceeded.
I added a mock API to return results in the event the API rate limit was exceeded, although the returned results were
not what the user expected, it allowed them to view the functionality of the app.
